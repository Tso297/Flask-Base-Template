This is a base level of flask. All apps must have this, you can use this as a base template.

Once this is copied! you will need to make your venv

the terminal cmd is this: python -m venv WhateverYouWantToCallIt

to tap into it, you activate it by WhateverYouWantToCallIt\Scripts\activate

You should now be tapped into your venv!

Make sure you fill in .env variables

Your next move is your pip installs on your terminal:
pip install flask python-dotenv flask-migrate flask-sqlalchemy flask-cors psycopg2 flask-wtf gunicorn werkzeug

Once install do pip freeze > requirements.txt

Any time you do a pip install, this should be your next move to get it into your package

Change Python 3.12 in bottom right corner to your my_venv terminal!

Write out models.py

Choose a website and setup your database (for our instances elephantsql or sqllite)

Then do flask db init (initialize is a one time only) and then flask db migrate and flask dbupgrade (think of this as doing your git commit and git push respectively.)
(ANY TIME YOU USE MODELS THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DO)

So in a nutshell this is the !cdbn5 bootstrap of flask... Sort of.

Make sure you make a .gitignore for:
my_venv (or whatever you call your venv)
.env
__pycache__
migrations

Start writing your routes and your models, and be mindful of your file organization AS YOU GO so you don't have to reorganize later or have to do so minimally.

(Models is required if you have a database)
(Blueprints are not required and can be plugged directly in the py file necessary)
